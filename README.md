# Awesome-Tkinter-Apps
***A collection of nice Tkinter based applications I find or end up answering on StackOverflow***

I learnt **Tkinter** during my [**BlockChain Database**](https://github.com/Miraj50/Blockchain-Database) project, in which I built the front-end using Tkinter. I would like to take this opportunity to thank [Mike-SMT](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7475225/mike-smt) and [Bryan Oakley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7432/bryan-oakley) whose answers helped me immensely in understanding the functioning of Tkinter.

Now, during the time spent in giving something back to the community I find beautiful Tkinter based applications on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tkinter) and I think it would be nice to curate them together so that people especially **beginners** can have a look at these (Also, it wouldn't be nice to just let them slip away into the past :worried:) and hopefully learn something of it.
